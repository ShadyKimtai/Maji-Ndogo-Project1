# Maji Ndogo Integrated Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the initial part of the Maji Ndogo Integrated Project. This project involves data analysis using SQL and Git for version control.

## SQL Data Analysis

The SQL data analysis section of the project aims to explore and analyze water-related data from various tables. It involves tasks such as data cleaning, querying, and generating insights to understand water source quality, pollution issues, and more. The project guides you through the process of querying and manipulating data using SQL commands.

## Getting Started

To run the SQL data analysis part of the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- You should have access to a SQL database, such as MySQL or SQLite.
- You may need an integrated development environment (IDE) for SQL, such as MySQL Workbench or DBeaver.

### Running the SQL Analysis

1. Make sure you have the necessary SQL database set up and running.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShadyKimtai/Maji-Ndogo-Project.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Maji-Ndogo-Project
Open your SQL IDE and connect to the database.

Run the SQL scripts provided in the project, following the instructions in the walkthrough.

Explore and analyze the water data to gain insights and clean the data.

Git Version Control
The project also involves using Git for version control, allowing you to track changes and collaborate on the project.

Setting Up a Remote Repository
If you want to share your project on GitHub or another Git hosting service, follow these steps to create a remote repository:

Create a new repository on GitHub or your preferred Git hosting service.

Get the URL of the remote repository. It should look like:

plaintext
Copy code
https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
In your local project directory, set the remote repository URL:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
You can then push your local branch to the remote repository:

bash
Copy code
git push -u origin master
Removing Remote Repositories
If you need to remove a remote repository, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
git remote remove remote-name
Conclusion
This initial part of the Maji Ndogo Integrated Project introduces SQL data analysis and Git version control. By following the provided SQL scripts and Git commands, you can analyze water-related data and manage your project with version control.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and share your project with others to showcase your skills in data analysis and version control.

For any questions or issues, please refer to the project's documentation and seek assistance from the GitHub community.

Happy coding and data analysis!
